# eCommerce-Application

## Final task in RS-School 2023Q1

This platform replicates real-world shopping experiences in a digital environment. It's a comprehensive online shopping portal that provides an interactive and seamless experience to users. From product discovery to checkout, the application ensures a smooth journey for the user, enhancing their engagement and boosting their purchasing confidence.

Users can browse through a vast range of products, view detailed descriptions, add their favorite items to the basket, and proceed to checkout. It includes features such as user registration and login, product search, product categorization, and sorting to make the shopping experience more streamlined and convenient.

An important aspect of our application is that it's responsive, ensuring it looks great on various devices with a minimum resolution of 390px. This feature makes the shopping experience enjoyable, irrespective of the device users prefer.

The application is powered by CommerceTools üåê, a leading provider of commerce solutions for B2C and B2B enterprises. CommerceTools offers a cloud-native, microservices-based commerce platform that enables brands to create unique and engaging digital commerce experiences.

## Available scripts:

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`  
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`  
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

`npm run build`  
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.

`npm run eject`  
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!
If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.
You don‚Äôt have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
